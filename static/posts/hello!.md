So I know its bit weird but the thing is I just made my cool web page, things still needs to be modified. Oh shit my bad I havent said hello to my new visitor, hope you are doing well and will be safe and sound and I am basically `33011337192005`. Pretty weird name, but there was something that inspired me pretty much and if have made the guess then cool if not then research. There is nothing special about my blog but here I just wanted to write my ideas, my thougths, what I think and what I not. Ah yeah I know the internet is big where my opinion doesnt matters but at least you can try. Apart from weird thoughts, I am also interested in some other aspects such as
<ul>
  <li>Security                           ----------- *****</li>
  <li>Internet privacy                   ----------- ****</li>
  <li>Anonymity                          ----------- ***</li>
